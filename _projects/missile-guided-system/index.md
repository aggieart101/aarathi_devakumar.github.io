title: ENGRourLimits: Missile Guiding System (MGS)
description:  During the annual TAMUHack competition, my 4 member team and I designed and built and missile guiding system, which is an unexplosive missile that tracks the x, y, and z positions of the missile. We used various sensors such as an IMU that tracks the derivative of rotation, an LCD to show the positions of the missile as well as an Arduino Uno and a breadboard to connect and power the missile altogether. We designed this system in less than 24 hours and stayed overnight cadding, 3D printing, soldering, programming, and wiring the system. We competed against 460 other teams from various universities in Texas. Unfortunately, my team and I did not win, but we learned a lot of skills during this competition and we are so grateful for the opportunity.
skills: 
- SolidWorks CAD Modeling
- Arduino
- Soldering
